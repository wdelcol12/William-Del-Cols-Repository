# AccountingEDU Information
THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE PROJECT.

Attached to this repository is my own project designed to generate random intermediate accounting questions. The whole basis of the program is for users to test their knowledge in accounting with random numbers and the system automatically computes the answer and the user can check their answers with the system with a given problem. The following sections of the program supports the randomized problems with a given section of intermediate accounting: Pension Planning, Diluted EPS, Weighted Average Shares Outstanding, Sale of Accounts Receivable, Inventory Problems(only Lifo and FIFO), and Treasury Stock. All the rest of the sections only support inputs that the user must put in that output an answer. Sections such as "T-Accounts" and "JE Log" are not supported and will not work. The code can be found in the source folder above and the instructions for downloading and running the program is below.

To run the program without any errors the users need to have three programs downloaded: Java, jdk14, and my project folder.

To download Java:
Click on the following link to download Java: https://java.com/en/download/
Press the link that says "Java download" and follow the instructions listed in the installer.
Nothing else to be done here.

To download jdk14: 
If the following instructions are unclear refer to this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kl7BgVVlGE or other resources on the internet just type in: "how to download jdk". Although make sure to download the latest version which is titled: "JDK 14"

Go to the following download link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

Under "Java SE 14" and "Oracle JDK" click on the "JDK Download" button. Scroll down to find the corresponding download link. Assuming you are on windows, download the link entitled "Windows x64 Compressed Archive" or "jdk-14.0.2_windows-x64_bin.zip". Once the zipped file is finished downloading. Go to your file explorer and the zipped file should be in your downloads. Right click on the zipped file and press "extract all". Choose the location of the file to go under the Windows C:\ section but it doesnt matter where it goes under that section. After it has extracted find the location you just moved the folder to, it is usually named "jdk". Press into the jdkfolder and then the folder titled "bin". You are going to want to copy the address or path that leads to the bin folder. The copied address or path should look something similar to this: C:\Program Files\jdk-14.0.1\bin. Lastly go to your control panel on your computer and type in the search bar "environmental variables" there should be an option of "Edit Environmental variables". Press "Environmental Variables" in the system properties. Under system variables there should be a variable that titled "Path". Select it and press "Edit". Press "new" on the right side. Paste the path to the jdk bin that you copied before into the text box. Once it is created, press the "Move Up" button until the text that we just pasted reaches the top of the list. Press "Ok" out of all the windows to save it and the jdk should be set up.

To download my project:
After downloading the jdk and Java to your computer you can download my project.
Go to the following link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/accounting-edu/
Scroll down to "Project Activity" and press "ACCEDU Executable.zip" which is the most recent activity on the site. This will download the project in a zipped folder. Go to your file explorer under downloads and right click the file and press "Extract all". Select anywhere in the windows C: to extract the file to. Once the extraction is complete, double click on "Launch" file to execute the program. This will open the command prompt and there should be a popup on the computer that displays the actual software.

If there are any errors(the most common being a jni error) please contact me.
