# AccountingEDU Information
THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE PROJECT.

Attached to this repository is my own project designed to generate random intermediate accounting questions. The whole basis of the program is for users to test their knowledge in accounting with random numbers and the system automatically computes the answer and the user can check their answers with the system with a given problem. The following sections of the program supports the randomized problems with a given section of intermediate accounting: Pension Planning, Diluted EPS, Weighted Average Shares Outstanding, Sale of Accounts Receivable, Inventory Problems(only Lifo and FIFO), and Treasury Stock. All the rest of the sections only support inputs that the user must put in that output an answer. Sections such as "T-Accounts" and "JE Log" are not supported and will not work. The code can be found in the source folder above and the instructions for downloading and running the program is below.

To run the program without any errors the users need to have three programs downloaded: Java, jdk14, and my project folder.
